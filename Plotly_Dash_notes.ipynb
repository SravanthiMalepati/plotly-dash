    "[Plotly Dash](https://plot.ly/dash/) is an open-source framework for building web-based data visualization dashboards. A dashboard is a collection of multiple data visualizations with UI elements to help manipulate the data and/or the visualizations. Often the multiple data visualizations are created from the columns in the same spreadsheet, but you can also visualize data from multiple sources. Dashboard is a popular tool for analytics because it helps users compare a variety of data simultaneously. If you want users to manipulate data visualizations with UI components (e.g., menus, buttons, sliders), you need to create Dash applications. Regular Plotly charts do not have UI components. \n",
    "\n",
    "Plotly Dash is similar to Tableau's Dashboard but you'll need to write code to create dashboards in Plotly. For examples of Plotly Dash, please see [this page](https://dash-gallery.plotly.host/Portal/). "
